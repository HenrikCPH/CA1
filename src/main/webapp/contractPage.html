       <p>We can all push changes to master branch, even if the code is not working. Just make sure to tell the group everytime something has been pushed.
</p>
        <p>This also means that  it is not a requirement that all tests pass, while pushing and working on the project.</p>
        <p>We meet everyday over discord and do some work together.  We can also work seperatly on the project afterwards.</p>
